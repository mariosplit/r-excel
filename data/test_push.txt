in RStudio, click on the "Tools" menu and select "Shell"
Run the following command: git push -u origin master
it might ask you for your git username and password. Supply this information, make sure it is correct
hopefully the push is successful, then you can close the window
Now make some more edits to some file so that you have new content to push
click on the "push" button in RStudio and this time the push should work

In the shell, with working directory set to the directory that holds your git repo, which is also an RStudio Project, what do you get for these commands:

git remote -v
git branch -vv
Also, have you simply tried restarting RStudio?

Are you using https or ssh protocol? If https, in the shell, have you had a successful push w/o providing any credentials, i.e. they've been successfully cached?
